# Alphanumeric_LCD_Library
This library is compatible with the HD44780 LCD standard and has an example main.c file as an example of how to use the library. This file uses a PIC18F45K50, although the library will work with any microcontroller provided you change the pin mapping. To define your pins simply go into the LCD.c file and change the #define definitions for RS, EN, D7, D6, D5 & D4.
